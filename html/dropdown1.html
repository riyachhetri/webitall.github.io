      <b><h2>BASIC TERMINOLOGY</h2></b>
      <br><br>
  <h3>Web Server</h3> 
  <br>
   <p>A web server is a computer that runs websites. It's a computer program that distributes web pages as they are requisitioned. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
  
    <br><br>
   <h3>Web Brower</h3> <br>
   <p>A web brower is an application used to access and view websites. Common web browsers include Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.</p>
   
    <br><br>
    
     <h3>Understanding how a Brower communicates with a Web Server </h3>  <br>
    <p>Web browsers communicate with web servers using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When you click a link on a web page, submit a form, or run a search, the browser sends an HTTP Request to the server.</p>
    
     <br><br>
    <h3>Website</h3>  <br>
    <p>A website is a collection of Web pages (files) coded in HTML that are linked to each other and to pages on other sites.</p>
    
     <br><br>
    <h3> Webpage</h3> <br>
    <p>A webpage is a document from the internet which can be seen with a web browser. Web pages each have a URL or address, which is how a page is found, and is different for every page.</p>
    
     <br><br>
     <h3>Static Website</h3> <br>
    <p>A static website contains Web pages with fixed code, the content of each page does not change unless it is manually updated by the devloper. Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to every visitor. Static sites are the most basic type of website and are the easiest to create. </p>
    
     <br><br>
     <h3>Dynamic Website</h3> <br>
    <p>Dynamic websites contain Web pages that are generated in real-time. These pages include Web scripting code, such as PHP or ASP. When a dynamic page is accessed, the code within the page is parsed on the Web server and the resulting HTML is sent to the client's Web browser.</p>
    
     <br><br>
    
     <h3>Internet</h3> <br>
    <p>The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world. Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.</p>
    
     <br><br>
     <h3>Intranet</h3> <br>
    <p>An intranet is a private network contained within an enterprise that is used to securely share company information and computing resources among employees. An intranet can also be used for working in groups and teleconferences. Intranets encourage communication within an organization.</p>
    
     <br><br>
    <h3> Extranet</h3> <br>
    <p>It provides controlled access to authorized people outside of the company. Much like the intranet, it allows for private communication, document and knowledge sharing, and transfers between crucial external partners and an organization. A good example of an extranet network would be Sharepoint.</p>
    
     <br><br>
   <h3> WWW</h3> <br>
    <p>The World Wide Web is another way to describe the Internet, which is a network of computers which are connected and that share information and allow communication around the world. </p>
    
     <br><br>
   <h3>  URL</h3> <br>
    <p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web.</p>
